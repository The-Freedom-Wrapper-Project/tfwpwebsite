### TFWP Website Design Project
- One goal of TFWP is to get people access to cheaper, effective, and more secure methods to achieve business and STEM-related educational success. A website does that on two fronts. First, it gives you a platform to collate your information for users in a more intuitive way than a ReadMe. Second, it gives you credibility. For whatever reason, people love websites with domains that look "normal". Call it a suspicuous disposition or maybe a product of cyber counter culture where phishing prevention practices are incepted into our minds daily. Either way, you will always benefit from a website.

- Our website is fully hosted on GitHub using [GitHub's Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature. For more information on TFWP Website and to see it in action, please visit it [here](https://thefreedomwrapperproject.com). Please keep in mind that it is currently under construction.
